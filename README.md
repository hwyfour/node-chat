node-chat
=========

> A simple n-user chat server based on Node.js

## Configure the Client

In front.js, change the current IP to the IP of your server

## Run the Server

Currently, the server is bound to port 80 which is reserved, so you will need to use sudo.

    sudo node server.js

## Connect to the chat server through a modern browser.

All of the client code is passed from the node server to your browser.
